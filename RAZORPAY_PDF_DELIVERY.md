# DishPrompt Razorpay PDF delivery setup

## Support email

Use **hey.dishprompt@zohomail.in** as the customer-help address. The website now opens a prewritten message with these fields:

```text
Subject: DishPrompt PDF help — Payment ID / Download issue

Namaste DishPrompt team,

Name:
Restaurant name:
Razorpay Payment ID:
Payment date:
Payment email/mobile:

Meri problem:

Kripya PDF download link share kar dijiye.

Thank you
```

## Recommended automated flow

The reliable flow is: **Razorpay Payment Link → Razorpay webhook → server-side verification → email with a secure download link → customer downloads the PDF**.

Razorpay officially supports Payment Link webhook events and redirect URLs. The webhook is the source of truth for fulfillment; the redirect is only the customer-facing success screen. Do not deliver the PDF solely because a visitor reaches a success URL.

| Approach | Tradeoffs | Cost | Setup complexity |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| **Recommended: Vercel serverless webhook + email provider** | Automatic, secure, scalable; requires a backend route, webhook secret, PDF storage, and transactional email provider | Vercel plan + email provider usage; often low at small volume | Medium |
| **Lighter alternative: Razorpay redirect + manual email fallback** | Fastest launch; payment is collected, but you manually verify Payment ID and send the PDF | Lowest setup cost | Low |

## Recommended implementation steps

First, create a Razorpay Payment Link for **₹999**. Configure its success redirect URL to a page such as `https://yourdomain.com/payment-success`. Keep the payment link public, but never place Razorpay Key Secret or webhook secrets in the frontend.

Next, create a server-side endpoint such as `/api/razorpay-webhook`. In Razorpay Dashboard, subscribe the endpoint to the relevant Payment Link paid event. Verify the webhook signature using the **raw request body** and your webhook secret before fulfilling any order. Record the Razorpay payment ID and customer email, then make the handler idempotent so Razorpay retries cannot send duplicate emails.

Store the PDF outside the public frontend bundle. The best options are private object storage or a file-delivery service that can create expiring links. The webhook handler should create a short-lived download URL, for example a link valid for 24–72 hours, and email it to the address collected by Razorpay.

For email delivery, use a transactional email provider with an authenticated sender such as `hey.dishprompt@zohomail.in`, or route through Zoho Mail SMTP/API if your Zoho plan supports the required sending method. The email should include the product name, payment ID, purchase date, one primary **Download PDF** button, the expiry time, and the support address.

Finally, use the redirect page only to say: “Payment successful. Check your email for the secure PDF download link.” Include the support email and the prewritten-help button as a fallback. This way, the customer can download from email immediately, while the website remains simple and mobile-friendly.

## Why the current static site cannot complete automatic delivery by itself

A static Vercel frontend can redirect customers to Razorpay and show a success page, but it should not verify payments, hold private PDF links, or send email because those steps require server-side secrets and an event handler. The current site therefore includes the customer-facing Razorpay link, support fallback, and email template. To activate automatic delivery, add a small serverless backend route or use a digital-product delivery service connected to Razorpay.

## Customer email template

The prewritten mailto link is already added to the website footer and support strip. Customers only need to fill in their name, restaurant, Razorpay Payment ID, payment date, and the problem they faced. They should not send card numbers, CVV, OTPs, or Razorpay secret information by email.
